# Getting Started

This directory contains all the examples for the getting started section of the
[official wiki](https://wiki.kryptonmc.org).

Examples are available for both Maven and Gradle, with both the Groovy and Kotlin DSLs for Gradle.

In addition, all are available in both Java and Kotlin, however, with the Gradle examples, examples for both
languages are included in the same project, with comments in the build files when something is optional and only
required for one of the languages.

The Java examples for Gradle will always be located under src/main/java, and the Kotlin examples will always be
under src/main/kotlin, in the root of the project (where the `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file is).
