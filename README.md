# Plugin examples

This is the repository housing example projects and source code for all the examples that are referenced by the
[official wiki](https://wiki.kryptonmc.org).

Each folder holds examples for the chapter that is named the same as the folder. For example, the examples for
the getting started chapter are located in the getting-started folder.
